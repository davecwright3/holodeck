Massive black hole (MBH) binary simulator for pulsar timing array (and associated) signals.

This project is being led by the [NANOGrav](http://nanograv.org/) Astrophysics Working Group.  This package, which is actively under development, is aimed at providing a comprehensive framework for MBH binary population synthesis.  The framework includes modules to perform pop synth using a variety of methodologies to get a handle on both statistical and systematic uncertainties.  Currently, binary populations can be synthesis based on: cosmological hydrodynamic simulations (Illustris), semi-analytic/semi-empirical models (SAMs), and observational catalogs of local galaxies and/or quasars.

## Installation

The `holodeck` framework is currently under substantial, active development.  It will not available on `pypi` (`pip`) or via `conda` install until it has stabilized.  In general all of the depedencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file and will be installed automatically.  One exception is the [`kalepy` package](https://github.com/lzkelley/kalepy), which is also being actively developed and modified - and thus cloning/installing `kalepy` manually may be preferable.

The recommended installation for active development is to:

**Install `kalepy`**:

1) Clone the holodeck repository: `git clone https://github.com/lzkelley/kalepy.git`
2) Perform an 'editable' local installation: `cd kalepy; pip install -e .`

**Install `holodeck`**:

1) Clone the holodeck repository: `git clone https://github.com/nanograv/holodeck.git`
2) Perform an 'editable' local installation: `cd holodeck; pip install -e .`

## Quickstart

The best way to get started is using the demonstration/testing notebooks included in the `notebooks/` directory.

## Documentation

The primary sources of documentation for `holodeck` are this `README.md` file, the notebooks included in the `notebooks/` directory, and docstrings included in the source code directly.  Eventually comprehensive readthedocs documentation will also be available, in addition to the methods paper(s).

## Contributing

Details on contributions and the mandatory code of conduct can be found in the [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) file.

To-do items and changes to the API should be included in the [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) file.

Contributions are not only welcome but encouraged, anywhere from new modules/customizations to bug-fixes to improved documentation and usage examples.  The git workflow is based around a `main` branch which is intended to be (relatively) stable and operational, and an actively developed `dev` branch.  New development should be performed in "feature" branches (made off of the `dev` branch), and then incorporated via pull-request (back into the `dev` branch).

(Unit)tests should be developed in two ways: for simple functions/behaviors, standard unit-tests can be placed in the `holodeck/tests/` directory.  More complex functionality should be tested in notebooks (in `notebooks/`) where they can also be used as demonstrations/tutorials for that behavior.  The python script `scripts/convert_notebook_tests.py` converts target notebooks into python scripts in the `holodeck/tests/` directory, which can then be run by `pytest`.  The script `scripts/tester.sh` will run the conversion script and then run `pytest`.

**Before submitting a pull request, run `scripts/tester.sh -bv` to run the builtin tests.**
For more comprehensive testing (e.g. against numerous python versions, and building from the sdist package), you can use the python `tox` package: simply run `tox` in the root directory and it will use the configuration specified in `tox.ini`.  The scripy `scripts/run_tox.sh` is also provided to setup and execute tox tests and required environments.

**Formatting**:
New code should generally abide by PEP8 formatting, with `numpy` style docstrings.  Exceptions are:
* lines may be broken at either 100 or 120 columns
